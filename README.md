This repository contains example code demonstrating a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError that can occur when calculating the average of an empty list. The `bug.py` file shows the original buggy code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version that handles the edge case gracefully.  This is a classic example of how to prevent runtime errors by adding robust error handling.
